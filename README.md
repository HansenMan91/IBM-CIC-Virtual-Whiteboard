# IBM-CIC-Virtual-Whiteboard  
Found the virtual whiteboard to be a fun assignment and is thus the one I have spend the working on.  
As the position I applied for is manily focused on frontend development, this is also where I have had my focus.  
I have put some work into html, css and javascript as these seemed as the correct tools for building a visual reprentation of a virtual whiteboard. I did not get nearly as far as I hoped and did have many more thoughts as what could be done.

What have been done:  
Have set up the main principles of a virtual whiteboard, by giving the user a sense of a real whiteboard by the use of sticky notes.  
The thought was in the bottom you have the taskbar, where you can select the colors and type of sticky note you wish to create.  
Here the functionality works but unfortunately I did not manage to build a succesful implementation of adding new videos, img and youtube videos as this was new experince to me.  
Moreover users are able to remove the sticky notes again but only after they have been marked as finished.  
I have also set up the skeleton or frontend aspect of a login.  

It was a great experience working on some classical ui design again and only wished there was more time to do so.  
Moreover, the thought process of the code is to diminsih the amount of actual content on the default html file and build most of it through code. For me it can give a cleaner overview of what is happening.  
  
How to approach:  
Since this is a frontend project all you have to do to take a look is to open the html file called: whiteboard.  
  
Thank you for a nice case.
